# Let
let: 
=> Declars a block scope local, variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
=> Allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
